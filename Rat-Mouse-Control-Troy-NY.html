<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound approaches as well as its array of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the likelihood that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>From the apple in your lunch box and the repellents that keep mosquitoes away, to the items that control mice in your attic, keep your pool clean and treat weed infestations on your lawn, pesticides touch many aspects of your daily life. This chapter offers a description of the major insect pests of oilseed crops and their management through the exploitation of various incorporated pest-management methods such as resistant varieties, potential biocontrol agents, and other unique approaches for increasing the quality and amount of oilseed crops.</p>
