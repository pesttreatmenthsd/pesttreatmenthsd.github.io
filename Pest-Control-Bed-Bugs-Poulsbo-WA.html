<p>Biological pest control steps benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
