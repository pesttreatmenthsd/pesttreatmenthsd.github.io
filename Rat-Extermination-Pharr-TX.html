IPM needs to continuously change to meet pest management challenges. Plant sap analysis data have revealed clear relationships in between leaf nutrient structure and susceptibility to illness or pests.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, environment control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>If you're dealing with pests that overwinter in the soil, combine row covers with crop rotation. For pest control, temperature must be 68 Â° F or lower, and relative humidity should be kept below an optimum of 70%; however, keeping climate conditions suggested for the preservation of books and paper will help to control insect populations. For example, feeding activities of certain caterpillars on the leaves of potatoes and tomatoes cause a systemic production of protease inhibitors revealed throughout the plant that disrupt the digestion process and feeding habits of insects (36 ).</p>
