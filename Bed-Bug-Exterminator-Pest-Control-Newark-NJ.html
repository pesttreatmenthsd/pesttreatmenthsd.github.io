In essence, the linking of IRM and IPM provides a management perspective that is the same as long-term, areawide pest management (Elliott et al., 2008). A pest control company does not just go directly to removing pests.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and recognize them precisely, so that appropriate control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.
