Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Bulletins to find out about low-impact techniques of pest control that reduce pesticide use and direct exposure. When you hire a pest control company, you are free to spend that time doing other crucial things.

<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for handling pests, has been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxins are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
